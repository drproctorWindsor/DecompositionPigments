<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Radiative transfer modeling of plant leaves relies upon knowledge of the main pigment in-situ optical properties such as the leaf refractive index and pigment specific absorbance coefficient. While considerable research effort has been dedicated to simulating the spectra of leaves over the lifecycle of leaves (from photosynthesis to senescence), there is little information about the spectral evolution of leaves post senescence.

This project provides open access to the current available information on decomposing leaf optical properties. Currently, the data sets provided have been derived using a decomposing leaf data set by optimization of the PROSPECT radiative transfer model. 

The repository contains the following PROSPECT data for monocot leaves:
* A leaf refractive index specific to decomposing leaves (the decomposing refractive index is unique since the loss of water increases the average value)
* An initial decay pigment specific absorbance coefficient which simulates monocot spectra at senescence
* An advanced decay pigment specific absorbance coefficient which simulates monocot spectra at mature decomposition

The available data will be continually updated as this is an active area of research.
